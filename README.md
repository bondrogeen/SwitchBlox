In this repo you will find

- Hardware files (in Kicad)
- Firmware files (C++ mainly) (Haven't started this yet, current the switch works without firmware as an unmanaged switch)
- Software files (Python) (Haven't started this yet, ideally I'd like a nice GUI to talk to the firmware to configure SwitchBlox)
